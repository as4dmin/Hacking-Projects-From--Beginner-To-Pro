## Introduction

Nmap is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. This guide covers the essential Nmap commands and options for port scanning, service detection, and vulnerability assessment.

---

## Installation

### On Linux
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
```

### On macOS
```bash
brew install nmap
```

### On Windows
1. Download the installer from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org).
2. Follow the installation wizard.

Verify installation:
```bash
nmap --version
```

---

## Basic Commands

### Scan a Single Target
```bash
nmap [target]
```

### Scan All Ports
```bash
nmap -p- [target]
```

### Service and Version Detection
```bash
nmap -sV [target]
```

### Operating System Detection
```bash
nmap -O [target]
```

### Aggressive Scanning
```bash
nmap -A [target]
```

### UDP Port Scanning
```bash
nmap -sU [target]
```

### Scan Specific Ports
```bash
nmap -p [port(s)] [target]
```

### Scan a Subnet
```bash
nmap [subnet]
```

### Save Scan Output
```bash
nmap -oN output.txt [target]
```

---

## Advanced Scanning Techniques

### Stealth Scan (SYN Scan)
```bash
nmap -sS [target]
```

### Script Scanning
```bash
nmap --script [script_name] [target]
```

### Scan Behind Firewalls
```bash
nmap -Pn [target]
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Scan for SMB Vulnerabilities
```bash
nmap --script smb-vuln* -p 445 [target]
```

### Detect Web Application Firewalls
```bash
nmap --script http-waf-detect [target]
```

---

## Precautions

- Always obtain permission before scanning a network or host.
- Unauthorized scans can result in legal consequences.
- Use timing options (`-T`) to balance speed and stealth:
  - `-T0`: Slowest, most stealthy.
  - `-T4`: Fast but noisier.
